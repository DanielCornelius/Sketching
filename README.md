# Sketching
Sketching is a Xamarin.Form wrapper around SkiaSharp.

There is a demand for a function to draw a simple floorplan in an app we are developing. 
Perhaps someone else has the need for that as well, hence we open-source it. 

The main "product" will be some kind of sketching view that can be added to a Xamarin.Forms app. 
The app included in this project is simply used for testing.

There is support for iOS and Droid at this point, but UWP will be joining soon.

I have no idea if it will be generic enough for anyone else to use it, but I guess we will see.

It is currently in a pre-alpha hackish state and I suggest that nobody tries to use it.
There will be a lot of changes in the near future.
