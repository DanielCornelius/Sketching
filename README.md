# Sketching
Sketching is a Xamarin.Form wrapper around SkiaSharp.

There is a requirement to be able to create a simple floorplan in an app we are developing. 
Since that's not the core function of our app we decieded to open source it.
Perhaps someone else has the need for that as well.

The main "product" will be some kind of sketching view that can be added to a Xamarin.Forms app. 
The app included in this project is simply used for testing.

There is support for iOS, Droid and UWP at this point.

I have no idea if it will be generic enough for anyone else to use it, but I guess we will see.

It is currently in a pre-alpha hackish state and I suggest that nobody tries to use it.
There will be a lot of changes in the near future.
